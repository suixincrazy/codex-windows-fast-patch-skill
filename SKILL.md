# Codex Windows Fast Patch

Use this skill when the user says Codex Desktop was upgraded and the Fast Mode / Plugins / Goal patch disappeared, asks to repatch Codex on Windows, asks to verify whether Fast Mode is really being sent, asks to restore/register the local plugin marketplace, asks to enable Chrome browser use or Windows Computer Use in Codex Desktop, or asks to enable/repair phone remote control while keeping third-party/API-key model access. Also use it when a custom provider or `/v1/models` exposes a new model but Desktop still hides it, when GPT-5.6 Sol/Terra/Luna are missing from the model picker, when the compact blue-purple Power slider falls back to the legacy Model / Reasoning / Speed menu because Statsig `available_models` filtering removed the required model combinations, or when the "Ultra in model picker slider" setting is visible but disabled because a third-party provider cannot load ChatGPT account user settings. Also use it when the language/locale setting reverts after restart, browser or plugin entries are hidden by availability gates, the Computer Control settings page shows "Any App" / "任意应用" as disabled by organization or unavailable in the current region, a Computer Use task reports native pipe, bundled plugin cache, helper path, package import, or runtime initialization errors, phone remote-control QR pairing spins/fails, post-pairing phone-created turns hit the wrong model API endpoint, Desktop new-chat/thread start fails with `missing field inputSchema`, local conversations disappear after switching `model_provider` / API account, restored conversations are visible but cannot continue because the current working directory is missing, or the user explicitly asks to configure the bundled custom `model_instructions_file` prompt asset.

## Platform Compatibility

This skill is Windows-only. It depends on the Windows Store/MSIX package layout, PowerShell, `Get-AppxPackage`, `makeappx.exe`, `signtool.exe`, Windows user environment variables, and Windows Computer Use helper paths.

Do not run this skill on macOS. A macOS adaptation needs a separate workflow for the Codex `.app` bundle, ASAR extraction and repacking, macOS code signing or quarantine handling, shell scripts, and macOS-specific Computer Use availability.

## Self-Update Preflight

Before doing substantive work with this skill, run the bundled self-update helper once, then reload this `SKILL.md` if it reports an update:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\codex-windows-fast-patch\scripts\update-skill-from-github.ps1"
```

The helper checks `chen0416ccc-cpu/codex-windows-fast-patch-skill` on GitHub and synchronizes only the skill allowlist: the tracked top-level files (`SKILL.md`, `README.md`, `README.en.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `SECURITY.md`) plus `agents`, `scripts`, `references`, and `assets`. 如果无法更新到最新版，则不要中断当前任务；继续使用本机已安装的当前版本完成工作，并在结果中说明未能更新。

An installed skill with `.skill-local-overlay` must also have `.skill-update-source.json` unless the caller passes an explicit `-Owner`, `-Repo`, or `-Branch`. The JSON file pins the intended fork source with `owner`, `repo`, and `branch`. The updater refuses to replace an unconfigured local overlay with its default upstream source, so a future upstream commit cannot silently erase local helper profiles or repair guards.

If the normal workflow does not explain a restriction, plugin gate, Computer Use failure, browser_use failure, or Fast Mode failure, read `references/restriction-debug-cases.md` before editing scripts or repatching.
If the task is phone remote control, QR pairing, mobile setup, isolated remote OAuth, remote-control WebSocket, or post-pairing API endpoint diagnosis, read `references/remote-control-debug-cases.md` before editing scripts or repatching.
If a removed plugin or marketplace leaves stale `[plugins."..."]` or `[hooks.state."..."]` tables in `config.toml`, use the orphaned plugin config case in `references/restriction-debug-cases.md` before deleting anything.

## Config Backup Rule

Before any action that can modify, regenerate, or overwrite `$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\config.toml`, create one timestamped backup of the current file for the task. This applies whether the agent uses bundled scripts, writes TOML manually, runs another helper, registers a marketplace, changes MCP servers, or repairs Computer Use.

The bundled scripts already back up an existing `config.toml` once per script run before their first write. If not using those scripts, do the backup explicitly before touching the file:

```powershell
$config = Join-Path $env:USERPROFILE '.codex\config.toml'
if (Test-Path -LiteralPath $config -PathType Leaf) {
  $backupDir = Join-Path (Split-Path -Parent $config) 'backups\config'
  New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $backupDir | Out-Null
  $backup = Join-Path $backupDir ('config.toml.' + (Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd-HHmmss-fff') + '.manual.bak')
  Copy-Item -LiteralPath $config -Destination $backup -Force
  Write-Host "config.toml backup before overwrite: $backup"
}
```

Do not proceed with a config write if the backup of an existing config fails. After writing, validate TOML syntax with `tomllib` when Python is available.

## Workflow Selection

Before choosing the full MSIX repack path, identify whether the current failure is a Desktop bundle gate or a local plugin/runtime repair. Do not treat a vague "Chrome/Computer Use is unavailable" report as enough evidence to run the full repatch.

- Use the Model Experience workflow for Fast Mode request/UI failures, new models hidden from the Desktop picker, the compact Power slider falling back to the legacy picker, or its Ultra setting being disabled under a custom provider. These symptoms share the same service-tier/model-picker area. Run `scripts\patch_codex_fast_mode_windows_msix.ps1 -OnlyModelExperience -DryRun` first; it checks the Fast request gate, Fast UI gate, model visibility filter, Electron Power slider `harborEnabled` gate, and Ultra setting persistence independently, then repairs only the broken parts in one MSIX repack. The Ultra fallback preserves the normal ChatGPT account API path and uses local `show-ultra-in-model-picker-slider` config only when ChatGPT user settings cannot load. `-OnlyCustomModels` remains a compatibility alias. Merge missing model metadata into `models_cache.json` only when read-only inspection proves the cache entry is absent; back up the cache first.
- Use the full repatch workflow for locale, plugin UI gates, browser_use Desktop gates, Goal gates, ASAR integrity, settings/UI availability gates, or when Model Experience repair is required together with those features.
- Before a full repatch after a Store update, compare the current-user and `Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers` results. The patcher selects the highest-version valid current-user or SYSTEM-Staged package, plus running-process candidates; it uses WindowsApps-directory candidates only if the all-user query is unavailable. This prevents an older user-installed package from hiding a newer SYSTEM-Staged build without selecting a package registered only to another user. Check the `selected Codex app` log before proceeding. Use `-AppPath` only when an explicit source override is required.
- Use the Computer Use Only workflow first when evidence points to a local plugin/runtime problem: `codex plugin list` marketplace errors, missing `.agents\plugins\marketplace.json`, missing or partial `openai-bundled` plugin files, `bundled_plugins_marketplace_resolve_failed`, `EBUSY` on bundled plugin files, native pipe unavailable, `missing-helper-path`, stale Chrome native messaging host paths, bundled plugin cache drift, Chrome/browser cache link drift, stale `SKY_CUA_NATIVE_PIPE` config, `@oai/sky` import errors, or `setupComputerUseRuntime` import failure. This class does not require an MSIX uninstall/reinstall unless a later check also proves a Desktop gate is still closed.
- If a Store update breaks an already-configured MCP because its `command` points into a removed `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenAI\Codex\runtimes\cua_node\<old-runtime-id>` directory, use the retired CUA Node MCP case in `references/restriction-debug-cases.md`. This is a targeted `config.toml` repair, not evidence for a broad MSIX repatch or permission to install additional MCP servers.
- If app/window enumeration works but the first screenshot fails with `SetIsBorderRequired failed` and `0x80004002` on Windows 10, treat it as a native CUA screenshot-helper compatibility failure, not a cache path or Desktop gate. Read `references/win10-computer-use-screenshot-backend.md`, then use `scripts\patch-computer-use-helper-win10.ps1` only when its read-only status reports the exact supported original or patched hash. Unknown hashes require fresh analysis and must remain untouched.
- If `sky.list_windows()` succeeds but a later independent `sky.get_window_state()` or `sky.activate_window()` call fails with `node_repl exec context not found`, read the cross-call approval case in `references/restriction-debug-cases.md`. On the exact documented `@oai/sky 0.6.2` helper transport, the persistent helper's approval callback can inherit the previous JavaScript call's `AsyncLocalStorage` store. `install-computer-use-local.ps1 -VerifyOnly` applies the hash-guarded request-context patch; `-StrictVerifyOnly` only verifies it. Reset the current JavaScript kernel after repair, then prove the fix with real captures in later independent calls.
- Use the Phone Remote Control workflow when the user needs mobile pairing/control, the Connections page hides the phone setup card, the QR dialog spins, remote-control setup jumps to ChatGPT auth, the Allow dialog fails, the phone says the Codex environment version expired, or phone-created turns reach Desktop but send model requests to the wrong API endpoint.
- Use the Missing inputSchema decision workflow when Codex Desktop cannot create a new conversation or local task and the newest Desktop log reports `method=thread/start` with the phrase `missing field inputSchema`. Do not assume this is always MCP. First compare CLI/app-server smoke tests against Desktop logs and inspect whether Desktop is sending non-null app dynamic tools. If the failure follows a suspect MCP server, isolate MCP. If CLI thread start succeeds while Desktop UI fails and extracted ASAR has `webview\assets\app-server-dynamic-tools-*.js` returning a namespace-wrapped `dynamicTools` object, use the Dynamic Tools Schema workflow. Do not run Phone Remote Control or Computer Use repair for this symptom unless separate evidence points there.
- Use the Provider History Sync workflow when old conversations disappear from the official Desktop sidebar after the user changes `model_provider`, API account, or provider config, but local `sessions`, `archived_sessions`, or `state_5.sqlite` data still exists. Also use it when the conversations reappear but opening/continuing one fails with `当前工作目录缺失`, `current working directory missing`, or `invalid codex request` caused by a missing historical `cwd`. This workflow is data-layer repair; it does not require third-party recovery tools, does not patch ASAR, and must not modify `config.toml`.
- Use the targeted bundled marketplace repair when the newest Desktop logs show fewer descriptors than the current package marketplace, or show `not_in_bundled_marketplace_plugin_names` removing a plugin the user had already installed. Descriptor presence means a plugin is available; it does not authorize installing or enabling optional plugins such as `sites`, `latex`, `deep-research`, or `visualize`. This should not trigger a broad repatch or Phone Remote Control workflow.
- Use `scripts\cleanup-orphaned-plugin-config.ps1` only for one explicit stale `plugin@marketplace` entry after that plugin/marketplace was removed. Run it without `-Install` first. It refuses writes while the marketplace remains configured or bounded marketplace/cache locations contain a matching directory, descriptor, or unreadable manifest; it never auto-discovers deletion targets.
- If the user asks for Phone Remote Control and ordinary Desktop features in the same repair, patch Phone Remote Control first, then verify Fast Mode/browser/Chrome/Computer Use. If the remote-control MSIX install disturbs Computer Use or Chrome native-host state, immediately run the Computer Use Only workflow and re-run `-StrictVerifyOnly`.
- Do not infer that a new `resources\codex.exe` PE file means `app.asar` is gone or that Computer Use needs binary patching. Inspect the current package resources first. If `app.asar` still exists and the symptom is a plugin/runtime import or cache failure, run `scripts\install-computer-use-local.ps1` before considering MSIX or binary changes.
- After a Computer Use-only repair, always run `scripts\install-computer-use-local.ps1 -StrictVerifyOnly`. Legacy layouts pass with `client import ok` plus `helper transport ok`; descriptor-only layouts pass with `runtime import ok` after importing the official `sky` export and calling `list_windows`. For a recognized cross-call request-context profile, strict verification must also report the exact patched helper-transport hash. These checks still do not replace a real screenshot in a later JavaScript call.
- Do not put Phone Remote Control into the default full repatch path unless the user asked for it. It is an opt-in workflow because it can require isolated remote-control OAuth, ASAR changes, a native app-server replacement binary, SQLite enrollment cleanup, and post-pairing API endpoint diagnosis.
- If evidence is mixed, use the lowest-disruption path first: run read-only triage, then `scripts\install-computer-use-local.ps1 -VerifyOnly` for local plugin evidence, restart Codex Desktop only if needed, and escalate to MSIX only when logs or extracted ASAR checks still show a closed gate.

## External Executor For Desktop-Restarting Repairs

If a repair can stop, uninstall, reinstall, repackage, or relaunch Codex Desktop, do not run it from the Codex Desktop session being repaired. Use an external Windows PowerShell session, the VS Code Codex extension, or another agent environment that will survive the Desktop restart.

The target state is the Desktop Codex home: normally `$env:USERPROFILE\.codex`. Do not use an isolated CLI entrypoint for Desktop repair decisions; if that wrapper sets `CODEX_HOME` to `$env:USERPROFILE\.codex-cli` or another isolated directory, it is not the Desktop plugin, marketplace, MCP, remote-control, or login state.

Before starting from VS Code Codex or external PowerShell, confirm no User-level or Machine-level `CODEX_HOME` is set. Do not set global `CODEX_HOME`, do not copy `.codex` into `.codex-cli`, and do not expose or commit `auth.json`, API keys, OAuth tokens, MCP credentials, browser profiles, or local credential stores. Start with a Desktop-state backup, run read-only package/config/log checks, then run the relevant `-DryRun`. Only use `-Install`, full `repatch-codex-windows.ps1`, or targeted `*-windows-msix.ps1 -Install -Launch -InstallPrerequisites` after the dry run finds and validates the intended targets.

## Default Workflow

1. If the task may modify `config.toml`, skills, marketplaces, or MCP server settings, create a state snapshot first:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\codex-windows-fast-patch\scripts\manage-codex-backups.ps1" -Action Backup
```

2. Inspect current-user and all-user package status so a newer SYSTEM-Staged Store build is visible:

```powershell
Get-AppxPackage -Name OpenAI.Codex | Select-Object Name,PackageFullName,Version,SignatureKind,InstallLocation
Get-AppxPackage -Name OpenAI.Codex -AllUsers |
  Select-Object Name,PackageFullName,Version,SignatureKind,InstallLocation,PackageUserInformation
```

The MSIX patcher automatically chooses the highest-version candidate whose `app` layout is complete, even when the current-user query returns an older installed build. Confirm its `selected Codex app` and `source package` log lines before installation. An explicit `-AppPath` remains authoritative.

3. Run read-only feature triage before any package reinstall. Capture the decision evidence, especially for Chrome/Computer Use:

```powershell
codex plugin list
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\codex-windows-fast-patch\scripts\install-computer-use-local.ps1" -StrictVerifyOnly
```

If `-StrictVerifyOnly` fails on a missing marketplace manifest, missing plugin files, stale `latest` link, stale Chrome native messaging manifest path, `allowed_origins`, registry value, or `extension-host-config.json` runtime path, missing helper path, or `@oai/sky` import/runtime issue, run the Computer Use Only repair first:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\codex-windows-fast-patch\scripts\install-computer-use-local.ps1" -VerifyOnly
```

This local repair may update config, plugin cache, Chrome native host paths and origins, user environment, and helper runtime files, but it does not uninstall or reinstall the Codex MSIX package. It invokes the current Chrome plugin's official `scripts\installManifest.mjs` with a user-local Codex CLI whose hash matches the installed package and with matching current `cua_node` `node.exe` / `node_repl.exe` paths. That official installer writes the outer native-host manifest, registry value, and required `extension-host-config.json`. The repair also synchronizes the current schema-2 app-server entry into both `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenAI\Codex\chrome-native-hosts-v2.json` and `$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\chrome-native-hosts-v2.json` using the current plugin's NUL-separated SHA-256 identity contract. Strict verification requires the exact current origin set from `scripts\extension-ids.json`, a stable current-version Chrome cache, existing current runtime paths in the host config, and a valid current entry in both v2 state files.

The repair must preserve the installed package's `plugins\chrome\scripts\browser-client.mjs` bytes exactly. Current Node REPL builds expose privileged browser capabilities only when the imported browser-client SHA-256 matches the trust list embedded in the installed `app.asar`; rewriting a `node:process` import or process shim changes the hash and causes `Browser use requires privileged node_repl capabilities` before Chrome discovery. Normal repair restores the packaged bytes to both the stable marketplace and versioned cache. Strict verification requires both copies to match the packaged SHA-256 and requires that SHA-256 to appear in the installed `app.asar`.

4. Before choosing a full MSIX repack, check whether this is the bundled marketplace fast path. Compare the package's `.agents\plugins\marketplace.json` names with the Desktop reconcile log. If descriptors are missing, or `not_in_bundled_marketplace_plugin_names` removes a plugin the user had already installed, run only the targeted bundled marketplace patch on a large local drive:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\codex-windows-fast-patch\scripts\patch_codex_fast_mode_windows_msix.ps1" -OnlyBundledMarketplaceCopy -DryRun -OutputRoot "<large-local-build-root>"
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\codex-windows-fast-patch\scripts\patch_codex_fast_mode_windows_msix.ps1" -OnlyBundledMarketplaceCopy -Install -Launch -InstallPrerequisites -CleanupAfter -CleanupWindowsSdkAfterInstall -OutputRoot "<large-local-build-root>"
```

After relaunch, run `scripts\install-computer-use-local.ps1 -VerifyOnly` and `scripts\install-computer-use-local.ps1 -StrictVerifyOnly -VerifyAllBundledPluginsAvailable`. The local repair preserves each unrelated optional plugin's installed/enabled state and refreshes an optional cache only when that plugin was already installed. The availability check requires every current descriptor name and version to match the installed package and to appear with that version in the CLI's installed-or-available JSON without calling `plugin add`.

5. Escalate to MSIX only when the evidence points to package-gated Desktop code: Fast Mode request/UI gates, locale gate, Goal/plugin UI gate, browser_use availability with `reason=statsig-disabled`, Computer Use/Any App disabled by settings/UI availability gates after local repair, ASAR integrity failure, or Phone Remote Control package patches. Otherwise do not run the full repatch just because a plugin is unavailable.

Run a dry run first after every Codex upgrade when MSIX escalation is justified:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\codex-windows-fast-patch\scripts\repatch-codex-windows.ps1" -DryRun
```

6. If the dry run finds all patch targets, run the full repatch:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\codex-windows-fast-patch\scripts\repatch-codex-windows.ps1"
```

The wrapper calls the bundled patch script at `scripts\patch_codex_fast_mode_windows_msix.ps1` with these defaults:

- `-InstallPrerequisites`
- `-Install`
- `-Launch`
- `-CleanupWindowsSdkAfterInstall`
- `-CleanupAfter`
- `-VerifyFastModeRequest`

It also verifies and writes the local marketplace config at `$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\marketplaces\openai-curated-local`, including `source_type = "local"` and the exact `source` path.
It also syncs the installed `openai-bundled` marketplace from the current Codex package into a stable local root, overlays a local `computer-use@openai-bundled` compatibility plugin, writes that marketplace into config, and registers `browser@openai-bundled` through the user-accessible Codex CLI. Pass `-VerifyAllBundledPluginsAvailable` to add an availability assertion for every complete descriptor currently offered by the installed package, including version-dependent plugins such as `deep-research` and `visualize`. The assertion itself uses `plugin list --available --json`; it does not download from the network, call `plugin add`, or change unrelated optional plugin state. The surrounding wrapper still performs its requested repair or DryRun behavior. When `.codex\.tmp` is a junction, the stable root is created beside the junction target so an existing non-system-drive layout stays off C:; otherwise it uses `.codex\marketplaces\openai-bundled-local`. It also repairs stable `browser` / `chrome` plugin cache copies so their `latest` junctions do not point at the mutable `.tmp` marketplace mirror, and enables `CODEX_ELECTRON_ENABLE_WINDOWS_COMPUTER_USE=1` for the current user so the Desktop app can expose Windows Computer Use after restart.
It patches Fast Mode in both the request path and the settings UI path. The request patch removes the ChatGPT-only branch while still reading host/model feature requirements; the UI patch removes the matching ChatGPT-only availability check in service-tier settings.
It also forces the configured custom model IDs through the Desktop model visibility filter. By default these are `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, and `gpt-5.6-luna`. On builds containing the compact Power slider, it also opens the Electron-specific `harborEnabled` gate so the matching GPT-5.6 model and reasoning combinations use that slider instead of the legacy model/effort/speed-only menu.
On builds where the Ultra slider setting reads only ChatGPT account user settings, it adds a local fallback for third-party providers. The toggle then reads and writes `show-ultra-in-model-picker-slider` locally, survives restart, and feeds the same Ultra inclusion value used by the actual model picker. Normal ChatGPT-authenticated users retain the official account setting path.
It patches the locale i18n gate that can force the Desktop UI back to English after restart when `enable_i18n` is disabled in the shipped webview bundle.
It patches Chrome/browser_use gates in both the webview assets and the main Electron feature sender/receiver path, covering in-app browser, browser pane, and external browser availability. This only unlocks the local Desktop gates; Chrome extension and native messaging files still need to exist and should be verified separately.
It also patches the Desktop webview gates that otherwise hide or disable Windows Computer Use behind the `computer_use` experimental feature and Statsig gate `1506311413`, and it writes `features.computer_use = true` into `$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\config.toml` without replacing the rest of the `[features]` table.
It also writes `[windows] sandbox = "unelevated"` into `$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\config.toml`. On Windows, this avoids the elevated sandbox setup refresh path that can fail with `spawn setup refresh` / OS error 740 and break Computer Use startup.
It also repairs local marketplace manifest layout when a local root has only a legacy root `marketplace.json`; the current Codex CLI expects `.agents\plugins\marketplace.json`, and missing that file can make `codex plugin list` fail for all configured marketplaces.
It does not install the bundled custom `model_instructions_file` prompt by default. Only install it when the user explicitly requests that optional configuration.
Any bundled script write to an existing `config.toml` first creates one timestamped backup for that script run under `.codex\backups\config\`.

## Phone Remote Control

Before repairing phone remote control, read `references/remote-control-debug-cases.md`. Keep these boundaries explicit:

- Remote-control pairing/control transport can legitimately call `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/remote/control/...`. Do not rewrite that transport to a third-party model API endpoint.
- After phone pairing works, verify the actual model sampling request URL. If it goes to the wrong model API endpoint, treat that as a post-pairing configuration diagnosis, not as part of the remote-control pairing implementation.
- Remote-control OAuth is isolated: use `.codex\remote-control-oauth.json` and `.codex\remote.json`; never use `.codex\auth.json` for the remote-control bearer injection path.
- An alternate build root is mandatory when the user says not to consume the system drive. Pass `-WorkRoot` / `-OutputRoot` on the requested large local drive and keep Cargo, Rustup, temp, target, MSIX, and source checkout under that root. Do not hard-code a drive letter into the workflow.

If `Settings -> Connections -> Control this computer` is visible but the device list says to sign in to ChatGPT again, verify the normal remote-control bearer before repatching MSIX again:

```powershell
python "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\codex-windows-fast-patch\scripts\refresh-remote-control-auth.py" --verify-only
```

If that reports `remote_json_disabled`, `access_token_expired`, `endpoint_http_error`, HTTP 401/403, or a token-refresh diagnosis such as `refresh_token_reused`, regenerate only `.codex\remote.json` with the same script. It uses the official Codex OAuth client, requests `openid profile email offline_access api.connectors.read api.connectors.invoke`, backs up the old `remote.json` under `.codex\backups\remote-control-auth`, defaults to proxy `http://127.0.0.1:10808`, and must not write `.codex\auth.json` or `config.toml`.

If `remote.json` verifies successfully but clicking `Add` or opening `Control this computer` falls back to a new conversation/main chat page, inspect `$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\remote-control-flow.log` and direct endpoint results for an expired `remote-control-oauth.json` enroll token shadowing the normal bearer. The ASAR patcher must skip expired JWTs before returning an isolated bearer and should verify `remote_control_auth_token_expired_skipped` in the patched ASAR. Do not delete `.codex\remote-control-oauth.json` blindly; keep it for fresh step-up/enroll flows and let valid `.codex\remote.json` satisfy read/MFA endpoints.

If the Allow dialog fails and the newest native app-server logs show `remote control requires ChatGPT authentication; API key auth is not supported`, ASAR patches and `.codex\remote.json` refresh are not enough. Build a patched native `app\resources\codex.exe` from the Codex Rust source with the reference native patch, using a large non-system work root when requested:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\codex-windows-fast-patch\scripts\build-remote-control-native-replacement.ps1" -WorkRoot "<large-local-build-root>\native-remote"
```

If the phone reports the Codex environment is expired after a native replacement, inspect the original installed native version before building. Use only an exact mapped Desktop/native/source-tag combination. For example, Desktop `26.715.2305.0` ships `codex-cli 0.145.0-alpha.18` and Desktop `26.707.3748.0` ships `codex-cli 0.144.0-alpha.4`:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\codex-windows-fast-patch\scripts\build-remote-control-native-replacement.ps1" -WorkRoot "D:\CodexData\rc145" -CodexSourceRef "rust-v0.145.0-alpha.18" -AppServerVersion "0.145.0-alpha.18"
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\codex-windows-fast-patch\scripts\build-remote-control-native-replacement.ps1" -WorkRoot "D:\CodexWork\phone-remote-26.707\native-remote-0.144.0-alpha.4" -CodexSourceRef "rust-v0.144.0-alpha.4" -AppServerVersion "0.144.0-alpha.4"
```

The build helper keeps the clone, Cargo cache, Rustup cache, temp directory, target directory, and any bootstrapped Windows SDK packages under `-WorkRoot`. When `-CodexSourceRef` and `-AppServerVersion` are omitted together, it copies the installed WindowsApps `app\resources\codex.exe` into `WorkRoot\tmp`, runs `--version` only on that copy, and selects a bundled version mapping; it never executes the WindowsApps binary in place. Desktop `26.715.2305.0` maps to `rust-v0.145.0-alpha.18`, `references\remote-control-native-replacement-0.145.0-alpha.18.patch`, and workspace version `0.145.0-alpha.18`. Desktop `26.707.3748.0` maps to `rust-v0.144.0-alpha.4`, `references\remote-control-native-replacement.patch`, and workspace version `0.144.0-alpha.4`. For historical `rust-v0.142.4`, matching parameters select `references\remote-control-native-replacement-0.142.4.patch`; that patch has passed clean patch-apply validation, but has not yet completed the same end-to-end native compilation validation as the newer mappings. Other source versions require matching explicit version parameters plus a validated `-PatchPathOverride`. Do not use GNU toolchain output for Windows MSIX replacement; use the MSVC target.

If MSVC is present but `kernel32.lib` is missing, the helper first searches for one coherent existing Windows SDK root/version containing matching x64 `kernel32.lib`, `ucrt.lib`, and headers; it does not mix independently discovered installed SDK versions. Only when no usable SDK exists, it downloads `Microsoft.Windows.SDK.CPP` and `Microsoft.Windows.SDK.CPP.x64` version `10.0.26100.4188` into `<WorkRoot>\cache\windows-sdk-cpp`. Downloads use `.partial` files, validate the archive and expected payloads, and replace the cache only after validation; corrupt cached packages are deleted and downloaded again. On Windows PowerShell 5.1, extract NuGet packages with checked `tar.exe`; `Expand-Archive` can fail while cleaning a deep `_rels\.rels` tree. The two packages use a split layout, so accept the matching NuGet roots `c\um\x64\kernel32.lib`, `c\ucrt\x64\ucrt.lib`, `c\Include\<version>\um\Windows.h`, and optionally `c\bin\<version>\x64\rc.exe` instead of requiring one traditional installed-Kits tree. Downloads honor existing `HTTPS_PROXY` / `HTTP_PROXY`; when neither is set, the helper uses `http://127.0.0.1:10808` only if that port is listening, otherwise it downloads directly.

Keep `-WorkRoot` short as well as off the system drive. A deeply nested D-drive root can still fail while Cargo checks out Git dependencies with `path too long`; the validated `0.145.0-alpha.18` build succeeded under `D:\CodexData\rc145`. When retrying after an interrupted or timed-out external run, first confirm the child PowerShell process has exited and use a unique `WorkRoot` / `OutputRoot`; a timed-out parent can leave a child cleaning the previous root.

Run a dry run first. Do not pass `-KeepWorkDir` unless you need to inspect failed patch artifacts; successful dry-runs should clean generated package and ASAR extraction output:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\codex-windows-fast-patch\scripts\patch-remote-control-windows-msix.ps1" -DryRun
```

If the machine needs a larger temporary build location, pass it explicitly:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\codex-windows-fast-patch\scripts\patch-remote-control-windows-msix.ps1" -DryRun -OutputRoot "<large-local-build-root>"
```

If a patched native `app\resources\codex.exe` was built from the Codex Rust source, pass it explicitly:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\codex-windows-fast-patch\scripts\patch-remote-control-windows-msix.ps1" -DryRun -ReplacementResourceCodexExe "<path-to-built-codex.exe>"
```

Only after dry-run markers pass, install and relaunch:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\codex-windows-fast-patch\scripts\patch-remote-control-windows-msix.ps1" -Install -Launch -InstallPrerequisites -ReplacementResourceCodexExe "<path-to-built-codex.exe>"
```

When `makeappx.exe` / `signtool.exe` are missing, the install path downloads Windows SDK BuildTools from NuGet under `-OutputRoot\.remote-control-temp`, not `%TEMP%`. Do not hard-code a local proxy for this download. Use the default direct/env-proxy path first; only pass `-BuildToolsProxy "http://127.0.0.1:10808"` or set `CODEX_WINDOWS_SDK_BUILDTOOLS_PROXY` when that proxy is known to be listening. Proxy URIs and credentials are never printed. `curl download failed with exit code 7` usually means the selected proxy endpoint refused the connection.

Run disruptive install commands from an external PowerShell process and judge the child's actual exit code. Under Windows PowerShell 5.1, do not pipe `*>&1` through `Tee-Object` when `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'`; npm warnings written to stderr can become terminating `RemoteException` records. Do not redirect child stdout and stderr to the same file. Use `Start-Process powershell.exe -Wait -PassThru -RedirectStandardOutput <stdout-file> -RedirectStandardError <stderr-file>`, check `ExitCode`, then merge or summarize the two logs after the process exits.

If an install attempt is interrupted after uninstall/signing and `Get-AppxPackage -Name OpenAI.Codex` returns no package, do not rebuild first. Install the existing patched MSIX from the selected `-OutputRoot` if it exists:

```powershell
Add-AppxPackage -Path "<large-local-build-root>\OpenAI.Codex_<version>_remote-control-patched.msix" -ForceApplicationShutdown -Verbose
```

Cleanup policy: successful remote-control script runs delete generated MSIX staging directories, ASAR extracts, script-local `npx` cache, installed patched `.msix` artifacts, and temporary Windows SDK BuildTools. If the user only asked for the repair and did not ask to keep reusable build outputs, also remove the native source checkout, Cargo/Rustup caches, target directory, temp directory, and generated patch/MSIX files created only for this repair. Keep the installed patched package, `.codex\remote.json`, `.codex\remote-control-oauth.json`, auth/config/sqlite state, logs, and explicit backups.

After installing Phone Remote Control, verify that ordinary features survived the remote-control repack. At minimum check live ASAR markers for remote control and browser local-patched availability, live native markers when a replacement binary was used, run `scripts\install-computer-use-local.ps1 -StrictVerifyOnly`, run `codex plugin list`, run the Windows sandbox smoke test, and verify the Chrome native messaging manifest points at a stable versioned cache path or at a `chrome\latest` junction that resolves to a versioned cache directory, never at `.tmp` or another mutable marketplace mirror. If the strict check reports a stale Chrome native-host manifest or missing bundled cache, run `scripts\install-computer-use-local.ps1 -VerifyOnly`, then rerun `-StrictVerifyOnly`.

When reading shared log databases, distinguish the running WindowsApps app-server process from old extension app-server processes. A stale Antigravity/VS Code extension `codex.exe` can continue logging `API key auth is not supported` after the WindowsApps package is fixed; filter by process path or `pid` before declaring the repair failed.

If phone-created turns reach Desktop but fail against the wrong model API endpoint, inspect the concrete request URL, `config.toml`, and the affected thread/session metadata before changing anything. Treat this as a post-pairing configuration diagnosis, not as part of remote-control pairing. Preserve conversation history and do not change `model_provider` ids just to change a URL.

## Dynamic Tools Schema

Use this targeted MSIX/ASAR path only for the Desktop dynamicTools variant of `missing field inputSchema`. Required evidence:

- Newest Desktop log shows `method=thread/start` with `missing field inputSchema`.
- CLI/app-server smoke tests can start a thread when they do not send Desktop app dynamic tools, for example `codex debug app-server send-message-v2 "只输出 OK"` or an equivalent `thread/start` path with `dynamicTools:null`.
- The Desktop log or extracted bundle shows the failure happens after Desktop app dynamic tools are assembled, not after MCP server startup.
- Extracted `webview\assets\app-server-dynamic-tools-*.js` returns the old namespace wrapper shape: `[{type:\`namespace\`, name, description, tools:[...]}]`.

When those conditions hold, patch the Desktop asset to return flat `DynamicToolSpec[]` entries with `namespace`, `name`, `description`, `inputSchema`, and optional `deferLoading`. Do not disable MCP servers for this variant unless a separate MCP-specific failure remains.

Run a dry run first. Use `-OutputRoot` on a large local drive when the system drive is low:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\codex-windows-fast-patch\scripts\patch-dynamic-tools-windows-msix.ps1" -DryRun -OutputRoot "<large-local-build-root>"
```

If the dry run passes, install and relaunch:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\codex-windows-fast-patch\scripts\patch-dynamic-tools-windows-msix.ps1" -Install -Launch -InstallPrerequisites -OutputRoot "<large-local-build-root>"
```

After installation, verify with the actual Desktop UI or newest Desktop logs. A CLI-only smoke test is not sufficient because it can bypass Desktop `dynamicTools`. Confirm the latest `thread/start` entries do not report `missing field inputSchema`, then run `scripts\install-computer-use-local.ps1 -StrictVerifyOnly` and `codex plugin list` if Computer Use, Chrome, or browser use are in scope.

Cleanup policy: successful dynamic-tools script runs delete generated MSIX staging directories, ASAR extracts, script-local `npx` cache, temporary SDK cache under `-OutputRoot`, and installed patched `.msix` artifacts. Use `-KeepWorkDir` only for failed or actively debugged runs.

## Provider History Sync

Use this targeted workflow when Codex Desktop local conversations disappear after switching `model_provider`, API account, or provider config, while the actual local history files still exist. The root cause is usually that Codex filters the official sidebar by the active provider bucket; older thread rows and rollout metadata remain under a previous provider.

Also use this workflow for the second-stage failure where recovered conversations are visible in the official sidebar but cannot be continued because Desktop reports the working directory is missing. In that case the provider bucket may already be correct; the durable source of truth can still point at an old `session_meta.payload.cwd` directory that no longer exists.

This workflow uses the verified local-history mechanism directly; it does not install or require external recovery tools. It reads the current provider from `config.toml`, then aligns provider metadata in local history stores:

- `sessions` and `archived_sessions` rollout JSONL first line: `session_meta.payload.model_provider`
- App SQLite store: `$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\sqlite\state_5.sqlite`
- Legacy CLI SQLite store: `$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\state_5.sqlite`
- Missing thread rows from the legacy CLI store into the newer App store when the App store is missing rows that still exist in the legacy store.
- Missing historical `cwd` directories referenced by rollout first lines, when explicitly requested with `-RepairMissingCwdDirs`.

Important source-of-truth details:

- Codex 26.609+ can rebuild `state_5.sqlite` from rollout JSONL on startup. Treat rollout first-line `session_meta.payload` as durable metadata, not the App SQLite row alone.
- Do not repair `当前工作目录缺失` by changing only one SQLite store. That can make the UI look fixed until restart, then backfill or rollout reads can reintroduce the old value.
- Prefer recreating the original missing `cwd` directory as an empty directory before rewriting historical metadata. This keeps the rollout history intact and was verified to fix visible-but-uncontinuable restored conversations.

Before changing anything, run a dry run:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\codex-windows-fast-patch\scripts\sync-codex-provider-history.ps1" -DryRun
```

Read the dry-run output before selecting the write path:

- If it shows mismatched provider buckets, close or stop Codex Desktop and run the sync.
- If the sidebar already shows recovered conversations but continuing a thread fails with missing working directory, look at `missing rollout cwd dirs before`. If missing cwd entries are listed, use `-RepairMissingCwdDirs`.
- If the missing cwd paths are outside the current user profile, do not create them by default. Review the paths first; pass `-AllowCwdOutsideUserProfile` only when they are expected local paths.

Provider sync write path:

```powershell
Get-Process Codex,ChatGPT -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Where-Object { $_.Path -like 'C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\OpenAI.Codex_*\app\Codex.exe' -or $_.Path -like 'C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\OpenAI.Codex_*\app\ChatGPT.exe' } | Stop-Process -Force
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\codex-windows-fast-patch\scripts\sync-codex-provider-history.ps1"
```

Missing cwd repair path:

```powershell
Get-Process Codex,ChatGPT -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Where-Object { $_.Path -like 'C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\OpenAI.Codex_*\app\Codex.exe' -or $_.Path -like 'C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\OpenAI.Codex_*\app\ChatGPT.exe' } | Stop-Process -Force
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\codex-windows-fast-patch\scripts\sync-codex-provider-history.ps1" -RepairMissingCwdDirs
```

This creates only the missing directories referenced by rollout first lines. It does not rewrite those `cwd` values, and it still verifies that `config.toml` is unchanged. By default it skips cwd paths outside `$env:USERPROFILE` to avoid creating unexpected roots on other drives or network shares.

Guardrails:

- Do not modify `config.toml`; the script checks the file hash before and after each run and fails if it changes.
- Do not install or launch external recovery tools for this workflow. The script implements the required local metadata repair directly.
- Do not patch ASAR or inject a floating session list for this symptom. A separate floating panel can show sessions but is not the official sidebar recovery mechanism and can introduce UI/encoding bugs.
- Do not sync `.codex-global-state.json` workspace/project roots by default. Doing so can expose many historical `cwd` values as empty project groups in the Desktop sidebar.
- Do not default to rewriting rollout `cwd` or forcing all missing cwd values to a fallback directory such as `Documents\Codex`. First try restoring the original missing directory path. Rewrite historical `cwd` only as a separately backed-up last resort after directory restoration fails.
- Backups are written under `$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\backups_state\history-sync-agent\<timestamp>` before SQLite or rollout writes.
- One unreadable or empty rollout first line may be skipped; treat that as a residual data issue, not a failure if SQLite and readable rollout counts align and the official sidebar shows the expected conversations.

Success criteria:

- The script logs the target provider from the current config.
- Both App and legacy SQLite stores, when present, report active and archived thread rows under that target provider.
- Rollout first-line provider counts under `sessions` and `archived_sessions` match the target provider for readable rollouts.
- `config.toml sha256 unchanged` is logged.
- Codex Desktop's official sidebar shows the recovered historical conversations after restart.
- If the symptom was a visible restored conversation that could not continue, `missing rollout cwd dirs after` reports zero or only reviewed/skipped paths, and the affected conversation can send a new turn after Desktop restart.
- The Projects/workspace area does not gain new empty project groups as a side effect.

## Important Guardrails

- The full MSIX install path removes the existing `OpenAI.Codex` package and installs a patched package. If run from inside Codex Desktop, the app can disappear or exit while the script continues. Use that path only when package-gated Desktop code must be patched; for local Chrome/Computer Use marketplace/cache/native-host/runtime failures, use the Computer Use Only workflow instead.
- The full wrapper verifies that the final package still matches the package version it patched and has `SignatureKind = Developer`. If Store replaces the package during repair, it retries once against the current package instead of reporting a false success; a second replacement fails with an actionable error.
- Do not modify `C:\Program Files\WindowsApps` in place. Use the MSIX repack script.
- Do not solve a Windows 10 `SetIsBorderRequired` / `0x80004002` screenshot failure by restoring an older Codex Desktop package or copying a helper from another runtime. Each bundled helper patch profile is limited to its documented exact input/output hash pair, backs up the original, and refuses unknown binaries.
- Do not treat `list_windows`, `runtime import ok`, a returned screenshot count, or a written PNG as proof that Computer Use capture is correct. For `node_repl exec context not found`, require later independent calls to pass after the request-context patch. Activate and revalidate the target immediately before capture, then inspect that the image content matches the target instead of an occluding foreground window.
- Do not run the phone remote-control MSIX patch as a default repatch side effect. Use it only for phone remote-control tasks or when the user explicitly asks for that workflow.
- Do not treat every `missing field inputSchema` as an MCP problem. If CLI smoke tests pass while Desktop UI fails and the dynamic-tools ASAR asset still returns a namespace wrapper, use the Dynamic Tools Schema workflow instead of disabling unrelated MCP servers.
- Do not trust a response like `FAST_CHECK_OK` as proof of Fast Mode. Trust only the wrapper/script wire verification, which runs with an isolated temporary `CODEX_HOME`, serves the CLI's `/v1/models` probe, then captures a `/v1/responses` HTTP body or WebSocket frame and checks `service_tier=priority`. A models-only request is not proof. If `codex exec` exits or crashes before sending that request, the verifier falls back to `codex debug app-server send-message-v2` and must also observe `thread/start serviceTier=priority`; the wire capture remains mandatory. If `PATH` resolves only to the protected WindowsApps CLI, the patcher must use the copied work-package CLI; an explicit verification request must fail instead of silently skipping when no runnable CLI exists.
- Do not use keyword hits in `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\logs_2.sqlite` as proof that the current installed package is patched. Task prompts and recorded tool calls can persist strings such as `local-patched`, `already-patched`, and patch marker names, creating false positives. Use the current patcher DryRun, direct evidence from the live package/ASAR, and real wire, UI, browser, or runtime smoke tests for patch-state decisions. This does not invalidate timestamped Desktop runtime logs when they are correlated with the current package, process, and test run; do not delete or modify `logs_2.sqlite` for this check.
- If the app launches then immediately exits, run Electron logging and check for ASAR integrity failures:

```powershell
$pkg = Get-AppxPackage -Name OpenAI.Codex | Select-Object -First 1
$manifest = [xml](Get-Content -Raw -LiteralPath (Join-Path $pkg.InstallLocation 'AppxManifest.xml'))
$desktopExecutable = [string](($manifest.Package.Applications.Application | Select-Object -First 1).Executable)
$exe = Join-Path $pkg.InstallLocation $desktopExecutable
$env:ELECTRON_ENABLE_LOGGING='1'
Push-Location (Split-Path -Parent $exe)
& $exe --enable-logging=stderr --v=1 2>&1 | Select-String -Pattern 'FATAL|Integrity|asar|ERROR'
Pop-Location
Remove-Item Env:ELECTRON_ENABLE_LOGGING -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

- If `makeappx.exe` or `signtool.exe` is missing, run the wrapper normally; it installs Windows SDK temporarily and removes it afterward.
- If the dry run or repack fails early with `robocopy failed with exit code 16`, inspect the configured `-OutputRoot` before changing patch targets. A common Windows failure is a broken junction such as `Downloads\codex-msix-repack` pointing at a deleted build directory. The patch script now recreates a missing reparse target when possible and otherwise fails early with an actionable `OutputRoot is a broken reparse point` message. Pass a valid `-OutputRoot` on a large local drive if the default cannot be repaired.
- If the local marketplace directory is missing, do not invent a marketplace. Report the missing path and ask whether to restore it from backup or re-extract it from a known source.
- For user-level Codex state backup or migration, use `scripts\manage-codex-backups.ps1`. It backs up `config.toml`, extracted `mcp_servers.json`, custom skills, marketplaces, and `chrome-native-hosts.json`. It excludes `.git`, `node_modules`, build output, and virtual environments by default; use `-IncludeDependencyDirs` only when an exact offline dependency copy is needed. Plugin cache and `.tmp\bundled-marketplaces` are also opt-in because they can be large.
- If `codex plugin list` fails with `failed to load configured marketplace snapshot(s)` and a local marketplace root contains only `marketplace.json`, copy that manifest to `.agents\plugins\marketplace.json` and re-run `codex plugin list` before diagnosing individual plugins.
- Do not manually delete a stale plugin table merely because `codex plugin list` omits it. Run `scripts\cleanup-orphaned-plugin-config.ps1 -PluginId "<plugin@marketplace>"` first, then add `-Install` only after read-only classification succeeds. The helper removes exact plugin/hook tables, removes an empty `[hooks.state]`, preserves line endings and unrelated IDs, writes UTF-8 without BOM, and verifies the backup hash plus TOML syntax.
- Do not depend on `Downloads\patch_codex_fast_mode_windows_msix.ps1`; the skill is intended to be self-contained. Use `scripts\patch_codex_fast_mode_windows_msix.ps1` unless the user explicitly passes `-PatchScript`.
- Do not enable the bundled custom `model_instructions_file` prompt unless the user explicitly asks for it. Treat `assets\system-prompt.md` as an opaque asset; copy/configure it, but do not inspect or summarize its content unless the user separately asks to review the prompt.
- In Codex 26.601.2237+, Fast Mode may be gated in `webview\assets\read-service-tier-for-request-*.js` as an async helper shaped like `return authMethod===\`chatgpt\` ? featureRequirements?.fast_mode !== false : false`. The patch should remove the `chatgpt`-only branch while still reading the model/host feature requirement, then verify with the wire capture.
- In Codex 26.601.2237+, Fast Mode may also stay invisible or disabled in the settings UI through `webview\assets\use-service-tier-settings-*.js`. The patch should connect the Fast UI patcher and log `fast-mode UI patch result`, not only patch the request helper.
- If the language selection reverts to English after restart, inspect the extracted webview assets for `enable_i18n`, `locale_source`, and `localeOverride`. The locale patch should log `locale i18n patch result`; do not treat a config-only language write as sufficient.
- If browser, Chrome, browser pane, or `browser_use` remains unavailable, inspect the Desktop log for `browser_use_availability_resolved`. `reason=statsig-disabled` means the local gate patch did not apply or the Store build introduced a new target shape; `reason=local-patched` means the availability gate is open and the next checks are the Chrome extension, native messaging host, and bundled plugin state.
- In Codex 26.601.2237+, the old plugin UI gate targets `533078438` and `pluginDeepLinkAuthBlocked` may be absent. Inspect `webview\assets\plugins-page-*.js` for `openPluginInstall`, `authMethod:`, and a compact assignment shaped like `{authMethod:x}=..., y=authBlocked(x),`; patch the auth-blocked variable to `false` instead of failing on missing old sidebar/skills/detail chunks.
- In Codex 26.616.3767+, `plugins-page-*.js` may insert an account-data hook between `authMethod` and the auth-blocked variable, shaped like `{authMethod:x}=authHook(),{data:y}=accountHook(),z=authBlocked(x),`. Preserve the inserted hook and patch only the auth-blocked variable to `false`.
- In Codex 26.616.3767+, the Goal slash command may no longer contain the old `3074100722` / `goals` config gate or `threadGoalObjective` anchor. If the composer computes goal availability from non-cloud/local state, for example `isGoalActionAvailable` passed through to `enabled`, treat that shape as already open instead of failing the MSIX dry run.
- In Codex 26.616.3767+, `use-is-plugins-enabled-*.js` may keep the same `featureName:\`browser_use\`` and `featureName:\`browser_use_external\`` semantics but use different minified helper names for the feature hook, statsig, and `runCodexInWsl` reads. Match the gate by shape around `featureName`, `enabled`, `isLoading`, `410262010`, and `runCodexInWsl`; do not depend on a fixed helper identifier such as `x`, `g`, or `u`.
- In Codex 26.707.3748.0, the Desktop feature sender can insert `findShortcuts` between `externalBrowserUseAllowed` and `computerUse`. Preserve that field while forcing the browser-use availability fields; do not require `computerUse` to immediately follow `externalBrowserUseAllowed`.
- In Codex 26.707.8479.0, the Electron feature receiver uses parameterized minified variables such as `o=r===\`win32\`&&n.CODEX_ELECTRON_ENABLE_WINDOWS_COMPUTER_USE...` instead of the older fixed `i` platform variable. Match the assignment, platform variable, environment object, and base feature object structurally; do not hard-code minified identifiers.
- In Codex 26.707.8479.0, `plugins-page-*.js` can place workspace/account derivations between `{authMethod:x}=...()` and the auth-blocked assignment. Locate the blocked assignment by the later `route.kind===\`manage\`` boundary and patch only that variable; preserve all intervening hooks and derived state.
- In Codex 26.519.11010+, `use-plugin-install-flow-*.js` may no longer contain `featureName:\`computer_use\``. For the Computer Use install-flow gate, locate the file with `installPlugin:async` and `openPluginInstall`, then patch the imported availability tuple so the first `.available` value for Computer Use is forced true.
- In Codex 26.707.8479.0, the Computer Use install flow can migrate into `plugin-detail-page-utils-*.js` and replace the literal `installPlugin:async` property with an `install-plugin` RPC inside a minified async mutation. Accept either anchor, require `openPluginInstall`, and patch only the first value in the three-entry availability tuple.
- In Codex 26.707.8479.0, the bundled marketplace copier can already route Windows through `copyDirectoryAllowDecryptedDestinationOnEncryptionFailure` from `windows-file-copy-*.js`. Treat that native Windows fallback as already repaired instead of replacing it with the older byte-stream fallback; still apply the independent bundled `sites` availability patch when needed.
- Do not modify `C:\Program Files\WindowsApps` in place to enable Computer Use. The Windows gate is controlled by `CODEX_ELECTRON_ENABLE_WINDOWS_COMPUTER_USE=1`, and the helper paths are supplied through the local `computer-use@openai-bundled` plugin.
- If Computer Use or a `node_repl` Computer Use plugin fails on Windows with `windows sandbox failed: spawn setup refresh`, inspect `$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\.sandbox\sandbox.<date>.log`. If it shows `codex-windows-sandbox-setup.exe` failing with OS error 740, set `[windows] sandbox = "unelevated"`. Check `codex sandbox --help` before verification: if the help lists a `windows` command, verify with `codex sandbox windows "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe" /c echo OK`; only builds whose help accepts a direct command form should use `codex sandbox "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe" /c echo OK`.
- If a Computer Use task fails before app interaction with `Package subpath ... is not defined by "exports"`, `Module not found: @oai/sky`, missing `setupComputerUseRuntime`, or an internal `@oai/sky` / `computer_use_client_base` import path error, treat it as local bundled plugin/runtime drift. Run `scripts\install-computer-use-local.ps1 -VerifyOnly`, then `-StrictVerifyOnly`. Do not patch `app.asar` or `resources\codex.exe` for this class unless Desktop logs also prove a UI availability gate is still closed.
- If "任意应用" is visible but disabled as organization/region unavailable, inspect `webview\assets\use-is-plugins-enabled-*.js` in the extracted ASAR. The relevant local gates are `featureName:\`computer_use\`` and Statsig `1506311413`; reapply the MSIX patch rather than editing WindowsApps in place.
- If the Computer Control page says `Computer Use 插件不可用`, check the Desktop log for `computer-use native pipe startup failed` with `missing-helper-path`, then inspect the `source` configured under `[marketplaces.openai-bundled]` and its `.agents\plugins\marketplace.json` plus `plugins\computer-use`. If they are missing or partial, stop bundled `extension-host` processes under `$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\plugins\cache\openai-bundled`, rerun `scripts\install-computer-use-local.ps1`, restart Codex Desktop, and confirm the log ends with `computer-use native pipe startup ready`.
- Current Codex builds can use a lightweight versioned Computer Use cache with no usable `latest` junction and no plugin-local `node_modules`; `@oai/sky` lives under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenAI\Codex\runtimes\cua_node`. Some builds are descriptor-only and omit `scripts\computer-use-client.mjs`. Treat that layout as healthy when the versioned descriptor matches the installed package and importing the independent runtime exposes `sky.list_windows`, which returns an array. For the recognized `@oai/sky` 0.6.2 Window2 profile, do not rely on a bundled runtime-documentation call; repair applies a guarded local skill overlay that uses `list_windows`, `get_window_state({ window, ... })`, and `activate_window({ window })`. Builds that still ship the client script retain the legacy client-import and helper-transport checks.
- If the failure reappears after fully quitting and reopening Codex Desktop, inspect `$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\chrome-native-hosts.json`, both `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenAI\Codex\chrome-native-hosts-v2.json` and `$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\chrome-native-hosts-v2.json`, and the real targets of `$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\plugins\cache\openai-bundled\chrome\latest` and `browser\latest`. A side-panel error such as `Codex app-server manifest entry is missing required path nodePath` can persist even when the outer manifest and `extension-host-config.json` are correct if both v2 state files still contain only old package/runtime paths or a wrongly hashed current entry. Newer Chrome plugin builds may canonicalize a versioned cache path to `chrome\latest`; that is acceptable only when the junction resolves to a versioned cache directory. Stale Chrome native-host entries, or a `chrome\latest` junction that points at `$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\.tmp\bundled-marketplaces\openai-bundled\plugins\chrome`, can also let Chrome native messaging lock the mutable marketplace mirror. Rerun `scripts\install-computer-use-local.ps1` to stop the lock holder, rebuild stable browser/chrome cache copies, repoint the outer manifest, and atomically synchronize both v2 state files.
- Do not build stable `browser`, `chrome`, `sites`, or base `computer-use` caches from the mutable `.tmp\bundled-marketplaces` mirror. Desktop can reconcile that mirror while files are being copied. Use the installed package marketplace as the stable source, then overlay the local Computer Use runtime directly into its versioned cache.
- If the failure reappears after restart with `plugin_marketplace_folder_write_failed` during `copy_plugins`, `bundled_plugins_marketplace_resolve_failed`, or `not_in_bundled_marketplace_plugin_names` removing a previously installed bundled plugin, patch only the bundled marketplace copy helper instead of running the full Fast/browser/Computer Use gate repatch. The targeted patch keeps the package descriptor set locally available but must not install or enable optional plugins the user did not select.

## Useful Wrapper Options

- `-DryRun`: verify bundle targets only; no install. Unless `-KeepBuild` is supplied, the wrapper asks the patcher to clean its copied build root after a successful patch stage. Cleanup is best-effort, so inspect the reported path when zero residual data is required; a later wrapper verification can still fail after the patcher has already cleaned its own build root.
- `-NoLaunch`: install but do not start Codex Desktop.
- `-SkipFastVerify`: skip the local HTTP/WebSocket `service_tier` capture.
- `-CustomModels <id1,id2,...>`: custom model IDs forced through the Desktop model visibility filter; defaults to `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, and `gpt-5.6-luna`.
- `-KeepBuild`: keep the wrapper's MSIX build root and retained artifacts for debugging after either DryRun or installation. The patcher's internal temporary ASAR work directory still follows its own cleanup policy.
- `-OutputRoot <path>`: optional large local build root; use it when the default output root is short on space, points at a broken junction, or should be kept off the system drive.
- `-OnlyBundledMarketplaceCopy`: patch only the Desktop bundled marketplace copy/helper availability path so Windows falls back to byte-stream copying when `fs.cp()` cannot copy bundled plugin files from WindowsApps-protected package paths, and so `sites` remains locally available when bundled availability filtering would otherwise remove it. Use this for restart-time bundled marketplace sync failures that uninstall `sites`, `browser`, or `chrome`, not for general Fast Mode or UI gates.
- `-OnlyModelExperience`: inspect and selectively repair the Fast Mode request gate, Fast Mode UI gate, custom model visibility filter, compact Power slider gate, and Ultra setting persistence together. Use this for Fast Mode, hidden custom models, the dependent compact Power slider, and a disabled Ultra toggle under custom providers. The legacy `-OnlyCustomModels` name is retained as an alias.
- `-SkipSdkCleanup`: leave Windows SDK installed.
- `-RegisterMarketplaceOnly`: only register `openai-curated-local`; do not patch Codex.
- `-PatchScript <path>`: override the bundled patch script only when testing a newer patcher.
- `-SkipComputerUse`: skip installing/verifying the local Computer Use compatibility plugin.
- `-VerifyAllBundledPluginsAvailable`: add an assertion that the stable `openai-bundled` descriptor names and versions exactly match the installed package and every entry appears with that version in structured CLI output as installed or available with an existing local source. The assertion never calls `plugin add`, but the main wrapper still performs its normal repair or DryRun behavior. For a fully read-only check, run `install-computer-use-local.ps1 -StrictVerifyOnly -VerifyAllBundledPluginsAvailable` directly.
- `-InstallModelInstructionsFile`: optional; copy the bundled prompt asset to `$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\prompts\system-prompt.md` and set top-level `model_instructions_file` in `$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\config.toml`.
- `-ModelInstructionsSource <path>`: optional source override for `-InstallModelInstructionsFile`; defaults to `assets\system-prompt.md`.
- `-ModelInstructionsDestination <path>`: optional destination override for `-InstallModelInstructionsFile`; defaults to `$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\prompts\system-prompt.md`.

Phone remote-control script options:

- `scripts\build-remote-control-native-replacement.ps1 -WorkRoot <path>`: clone/patch/build the native replacement under the selected work root, keeping Cargo/Rustup/temp/target/source artifacts and the fallback Windows SDK C++ NuGet cache off the system drive. With both version parameters omitted, it auto-detects the installed native version from a temporary WorkRoot copy; if the detected version has no mapping, it requires explicit parameters instead of assuming 0.144.
- `-CodexSourceRef <rust-vX> -AppServerVersion <X>`: always supply these as an exact matching pair when overriding auto-detection. `0.145.0-alpha.18` is exact-tag build/install/phone end-to-end validated with Desktop `26.715.2305.0`; `0.144.0-alpha.4` has the same validation scope with Desktop `26.707.3748.0`; the dedicated `0.142.4` patch is patch-apply validated but not yet fully compiled in this workflow.
- `-PatchPathOverride <path>`: use only with an exact matching source-ref/app-server version pair, after validating that the supplied patch targets that exact source; patch apply is still checked before compilation.
- `-SkipBuild`: reuse only a previously generated binary accompanied by `codex.remote-control-build.json`. The helper verifies the exact Git commit, source ref, app-server version, patch SHA-256, Rust toolchain, target, profile, binary `--version`, and native markers; marker-only or unstamped stale binaries are rejected. It does not initialize or download the Windows SDK in this mode.
- `scripts\patch-remote-control-windows-msix.ps1 -DryRun`: patch and validate extracted package without installing, then clean successful generated artifacts.
- `-KeepWorkDir`: keep MSIX staging, ASAR extract, and script-local `npx` cache for debugging; avoid this on routine repairs because each kept run can consume multiple GB.
- `-OutputRoot <path>`: optional large local build root; use it when the default temp/output drive is short on space.
- `-ReplacementResourceCodexExe <path>`: copy in a patched native app-server binary and verify remote-control markers before packaging.
- `-Install -Launch -InstallPrerequisites`: sign, install, and relaunch the patched package after dry-run passes.

Dynamic tools schema script options:

- `scripts\patch-dynamic-tools-windows-msix.ps1 -DryRun`: extract current package, patch/verify `app-server-dynamic-tools-*.js`, run `node --check`, then clean successful generated artifacts without installing.
- `-OutputRoot <path>`: optional large local build root; use it when the system drive is short on space.
- `-Install -Launch -InstallPrerequisites`: sign, install, and relaunch the targeted dynamicTools patched package after dry-run passes.
- `-KeepWorkDir`: keep MSIX staging, ASAR extract, and script-local `npx` cache for debugging only.

## Optional Model Instructions File

This workflow has an optional custom model instructions installer. It is not part of the default repatch flow and should only run when the user asks for that extra configuration.

To install only the bundled prompt asset and configure Codex:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\codex-windows-fast-patch\scripts\install-model-instructions-file.ps1"
```

The installer copies `assets\system-prompt.md` to `$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\prompts\system-prompt.md`, writes this top-level TOML entry, validates TOML syntax when Python is available, and logs a timestamped backup of any existing `config.toml`:

```toml
model_instructions_file = 'C:\Users\<user>\.codex\prompts\system-prompt.md'
```

To combine it with the main wrapper, add `-InstallModelInstructionsFile` explicitly:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\codex-windows-fast-patch\scripts\repatch-codex-windows.ps1" -InstallModelInstructionsFile
```

To verify the current machine without changing files:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\codex-windows-fast-patch\scripts\install-model-instructions-file.ps1" -VerifyOnly
```

After configuring `model_instructions_file`, restart Codex CLI/Desktop or start a new session so the new model instructions file is loaded.

## Computer Use Only

Use this path for local Computer Use plugin/runtime repair without repacking the MSIX. It rebuilds the local `openai-bundled` marketplace mirror, repairs stable `computer-use` / `browser` / `chrome` / `sites` cache links from one pinned installed-package source, overlays the installed CUA `@oai/sky` runtime into the local Computer Use plugin, patches localized/default-value Chrome registry parsing and the Computer Use client import shape when needed, preserves a live `SKY_CUA_NATIVE_PIPE` configuration while removing stale overrides, updates the Chrome native messaging host and both schema-2 app-server state files to current stable cache/runtime paths, and verifies the client import or independent runtime transport.

If enumeration works but a later Computer Use call returns `node_repl exec context not found`, inspect the source profile before repair:

```powershell
$contextPatcher = "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\codex-windows-fast-patch\scripts\patch-computer-use-node-repl-context.ps1"
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File $contextPatcher
```

The documented `@oai/sky 0.6.2` profile is `6423BA83...702B7C` -> `3600AC24...5BB60A`. Prefer the normal `install-computer-use-local.ps1 -VerifyOnly` path to install it, then reset the current `node_repl` JavaScript kernel and rerun `-StrictVerifyOnly`. The patcher backs up the exact original under `.codex\backups\computer-use-node-repl-context` and supports `-Rollback`; it rejects unknown hashes. End-to-end validation must start the helper in one JavaScript call and capture a controlled, freshly activated window in later calls so the test exercises the stale-context boundary.

If Windows 10 reaches the native helper but screenshot capture fails specifically at `SetIsBorderRequired` with `0x80004002`, inspect the helper profile before rerunning the general local repair:

```powershell
$helperPatcher = "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\codex-windows-fast-patch\scripts\patch-computer-use-helper-win10.ps1"
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File $helperPatcher
```

Only an `original-patchable` result for one of the documented complete helper SHA-256 profiles authorizes further evaluation. A real write additionally requires Windows 10 and the exact `SetIsBorderRequired / 0x80004002` screenshot failure; a matching hash on Windows 11 is not authorization. The current profiles are `@oai/sky 0.4.20` validated with Desktop `26.707.12708.0`, `@oai/sky 0.5.2` validated with Desktop `26.721.4979.0`, and `@oai/sky 0.6.6` validated with Desktop `26.803.10989.0`; the helper hash, not the Desktop version, is the binary compatibility boundary:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File $helperPatcher -Install
```

The patcher verifies the complete output hash, stores the original under `.codex\backups\computer-use-helper`, and supports `-Rollback`. After installation, continue with `-VerifyOnly`, `-StrictVerifyOnly`, and real Explorer/Task Manager Computer Use captures. Do not apply the profile to an unknown helper hash.

To refresh only the local Windows Computer Use files and environment gate:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\codex-windows-fast-patch\scripts\install-computer-use-local.ps1"
```

To verify and automatically repair missing local Computer Use files:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\codex-windows-fast-patch\scripts\install-computer-use-local.ps1" -VerifyOnly
```

To verify without changing files:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\codex-windows-fast-patch\scripts\install-computer-use-local.ps1" -StrictVerifyOnly
```

If `-StrictVerifyOnly` fails because a cache path is missing or stale, run `-VerifyOnly` once, then rerun `-StrictVerifyOnly`. If `-VerifyOnly` succeeds but Desktop still reports native pipe unavailable, restart Codex Desktop and inspect the newest Desktop log for `computer-use native pipe startup ready`.

## Backup Management

To classify one stale plugin entry without changing config:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\codex-windows-fast-patch\scripts\cleanup-orphaned-plugin-config.ps1" -PluginId "obsolete-helper@personal"
```

Only after the read-only result confirms the marketplace is absent and no bounded disk evidence remains, add `-Install`. The script creates and hash-verifies a `config.toml` backup before removing the exact plugin/hook tables.

To back up local Codex config, MCP server entries, custom skills, marketplaces, and Chrome native-host state:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\codex-windows-fast-patch\scripts\manage-codex-backups.ps1" -Action Backup
```

To list or restore snapshots:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\codex-windows-fast-patch\scripts\manage-codex-backups.ps1" -Action List
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\codex-windows-fast-patch\scripts\manage-codex-backups.ps1" -Action Restore -BackupPath "<backup path>"
```

## Success Criteria

- If an existing `config.toml` was modified, the log shows a timestamped backup under `.codex\backups\config\`.
- The patch log's `selected Codex app` and `source package` lines identify the intended highest-version package, including a newer SYSTEM-Staged Store package when present.
- `Get-AppxPackage -Name OpenAI.Codex` shows `SignatureKind = Developer`.
- The install log launches the patched Desktop package through its AppUserModelId, avoiding direct-executable access failures under `WindowsApps`.
- The manifest-declared Codex Desktop process stays alive from the installed package, currently `...\app\ChatGPT.exe` on newer builds and `...\app\Codex.exe` on older builds.
- Fast Mode verification reaches `/v1/responses` and logs `request wire service_tier=priority`; `/v1/models` probes alone do not pass verification. When the app-server fallback is used, it also logs `thread/start serviceTier=priority`.
- The patch log includes `fast-mode UI patch result` and `locale i18n patch result`, each either `patched` or `already-patched`.
- The patch log includes `custom models patch result`, and the patched model filter contains all configured custom model IDs.
- The patch log includes `browser-use gate patch result`, either `patched` or `already-patched`.
- Desktop logs show `browser_use_availability_resolved` with `available=true` and `reason=local-patched` after the patched app starts.
- `$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\config.toml` contains `[marketplaces.openai-curated-local]`.
- `$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\config.toml` contains `[marketplaces.openai-bundled]` pointing at the stable local marketplace selected by `install-computer-use-local.ps1`, never the Desktop-owned `.tmp\bundled-marketplaces` path, and that marketplace contains the installed bundled plugins plus the local Computer Use overlay.
- Any configured local marketplace used for personal plugins has a supported `.agents\plugins\marketplace.json`; root-level `marketplace.json` alone is not enough for the current plugin CLI.
- `codex plugin list` shows the plugins required by the requested repair, including `browser@openai-bundled`, `chrome@openai-bundled`, and `computer-use@openai-bundled` for Browser/Chrome/Computer Use work, as `installed, enabled`. Optional plugins retain their prior state.
- When `-VerifyAllBundledPluginsAvailable` is requested, every complete descriptor in the stable `openai-bundled` marketplace has the same name and version as the installed package and appears with that version in the union of CLI `installed` and `available` JSON entries with an existing local source; no optional plugin becomes installed or enabled as a side effect.
- Recent Desktop logs retain the current package's bundled descriptor names and do not show `not_in_bundled_marketplace_plugin_names` removing a plugin that was already installed.
- `$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\config.toml` contains `[plugins."computer-use@openai-bundled"]` with `enabled = true`.
- `codex plugin list` shows `computer-use@openai-bundled` as `installed, enabled`.
- If Chrome/browser use is required, `codex plugin list` shows `chrome@openai-bundled` and `browser@openai-bundled` as `installed, enabled`, the Chrome native messaging host manifest points to a stable current-version cache rather than `.tmp\bundled-marketplaces`, and its origins exactly match the current `extension-ids.json`. The `extension-host.exe` directory contains `extension-host-config.json` with schema 1, the current package-matching user-local `codex.exe`, and current same-runtime `node.exe` / `node_repl.exe` paths. Both `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenAI\Codex\chrome-native-hosts-v2.json` and `$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\chrome-native-hosts-v2.json` contain the same current schema-2 entry, official NUL-separated SHA-256 identity, installed-package `resourcesPath`, and existing runtime/cache paths. The active marketplace and versioned-cache `browser-client.mjs` hashes match the installed package, that hash appears in the installed `app.asar` trust list, `setupBrowserRuntime()` succeeds, and `agent.browsers.get("chrome")` returns the Chrome extension backend. `chrome\latest` and `browser\latest` (when present) resolve to stable version directories, and a real smoke test can read a controlled tab title such as `Example Domain`.
- When Chrome/browser smoke validation is in scope and Chrome is not running, launch Chrome automatically without requesting additional user authorization. Run the controlled `https://example.com/` smoke test and verify its URL, `Example Domain` title, exactly one `h1`, and `Example Domain` heading text.
- `CODEX_ELECTRON_ENABLE_WINDOWS_COMPUTER_USE` is set to `1` for the current user.
- `$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\config.toml` contains `[features]` with `computer_use = true`.
- `$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\config.toml` contains `[windows]` with `sandbox = "unelevated"`, and the sandbox command syntax shown by `codex sandbox --help` succeeds.
- The Computer Use plugin cache matches the installed package. Support both legacy `computer-use\latest\node_modules\@oai\sky` and the current lightweight versioned or descriptor-only cache plus `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenAI\Codex\runtimes\cua_node`; validation reaches `list_windows` either through the helper transport or the official independent runtime export.
- `scripts\install-computer-use-local.ps1 -StrictVerifyOnly` logs `client import ok` and `helper transport ok` for legacy layouts, or `runtime import ok` with `method=list_windows` for descriptor-only layouts.
- For the supported `@oai/sky 0.6.2` cross-call approval profile, `scripts\patch-computer-use-node-repl-context.ps1` reports `patched` with SHA-256 `3600AC240CD6CB7029F1E489DF990CAE22D72177350B8084412DF1F3FA5BB60A`, and its original backup matches `6423BA834F18139D55CDAC2290C91CD9B24B568332B07CDDD2A7EDA043702B7C`.
- Real Computer Use acceptance starts the persistent helper during one `node_repl` call, then uses at least two later calls to activate and capture a stable non-minimized target. Each call returns the expected window, accessibility state when requested, and a normal-sized screenshot whose visible content matches the target. A screenshot count or PNG file without content inspection is not acceptance.
- For the supported Windows 10 screenshot-helper profiles, `scripts\patch-computer-use-helper-win10.ps1` reports `patched` with the selected profile's complete output SHA-256 and an original backup matching the profile's complete input SHA-256. Each documented profile has repeated-static resource checks and dynamic-capture image-change checks. Their pairs are `0.4.20`: `F2B2F56F...` -> `71A13CBC...`, `0.5.2`: `2C4CAC16...` -> `D816B14A...`, `0.6.6`: `BE488E66...` -> `34D6EB4F...`, `0.6.11`: `DE07F17A...` -> `40530E62...`, and `0.6.11`: `7A95D14E...` -> `E84A4ECB...`. One `@oai/sky` version can ship more than one helper binary, so select a profile by the complete hash and never by the version string. The `0.6.6` baseline includes a cold Explorer capture, two batches of ten unchanged static captures, twenty-capture post-warm-up resource counts, and three distinct Task Manager performance frames. A dynamic-capture check must activate the target and select a continuously animating view, because a backgrounded Task Manager Processes tab does not repaint and would yield identical frames for reasons unrelated to the patch.
- The patched ASAR has the Computer Use availability and install gates forced local-available. On newer builds these targets can be merged into `webview\assets\app-initial-*.js` instead of the older `use-is-plugins-enabled-*` and `use-plugin-install-flow-*` chunks.
- The patched ASAR has the Fast Mode UI gate unblocked, the locale chunk with `enable_i18n` forced enabled, and browser_use feature chunks/main feature dispatch patched to report in-app and external browser availability locally. Codex Desktop `26.721.3996.0` can merge the Fast UI, model visibility, and Browser sidebar targets into `webview\assets\app-initial-*.js`.
- For phone remote-control repair, the patched ASAR contains `remote_control_desktop_fetch_override_used`, `remote_control_auth_token_expired_skipped`, `remote_control_mobile_setup_no_auth_redirect`, `remote_control_mobile_setup_authorize_before_enable`, `remote_control_mfa_info_403_nonblocking`, `remote_control_client_list_partial_failure_nonblocking`, `remote_control_settings_force_control_this_pc_visible`, `remote_control_settings_force_remote_control_section_visible`, and `remote_control_qm_start`.
- For phone remote-control repair with a native replacement, live `app\resources\codex.exe` contains `remote_control_app_server_isolated_oauth_used`, `remote_control_native_remote_json_first`, `remote_control_websocket_proxy_attempt`, `remote_control_websocket_proxy_connected`, `remote-control-oauth.json`, `remote.json`, and `codex.remote_control.enroll`.
- For phone remote-control device-list login errors, `scripts\refresh-remote-control-auth.py --verify-only` reports `ok: true` against `/backend-api/wham/remote/control/clients`; if the script regenerated auth, the previous `.codex\remote.json` was backed up and `.codex\auth.json` plus `config.toml` were not modified.
- For phone remote-control repair, `Settings -> Connections` shows the mobile/phone setup path, the QR code appears, phone scan no longer reports an expired Codex environment, PID/path-correlated native logs show `remote_control_websocket_proxy_connected` and status `Connected` without repeated Windows `os error 10060`, and phone-sent turns reach Desktop. Ping/Pong frame text is optional because some native versions handle those frames without logging them. If a phone-sent turn then targets the wrong model API endpoint, handle it as the post-pairing configuration case.
- For Dynamic Tools Schema repair, the patched ASAR has `webview\assets\app-server-dynamic-tools-*.js` returning flat entries containing `namespace`, `name`, `description`, and `inputSchema` instead of a namespace wrapper object, `node --check` passes for that asset, and actual Desktop new-chat/thread creation no longer logs `missing field inputSchema`.
- For Provider History Sync, both App and legacy SQLite stores report thread rows under the current provider, readable rollout first lines use the current provider, `config.toml sha256 unchanged` is logged, official Desktop conversations reappear, and no new empty project groups are introduced.
- For orphaned plugin config cleanup, read-only classification succeeds before `-Install`; the write run reports a SHA-256-verified backup, valid TOML, no UTF-8 BOM, absence of the exact plugin/hook tables, and preservation of similar IDs and unrelated tables.
- `makeappx.exe` and `signtool.exe` are missing again if SDK cleanup was enabled.
